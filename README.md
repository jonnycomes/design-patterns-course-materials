# Design Patterns Course Materials (C++)

This repository contains materials from a short course on **object-oriented design and design patterns in C++**, structured around the *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* book by the "Gang of Four."

It can serve as a resource for anyone learning design patterns with C++, especially those who want hands-on practice with code and diagrams.

## What’s in the Repo?

The material is organized as a series of **worksheets** and accompanying **starter code**, designed to help learners engage with core concepts and apply patterns in small, focused exercises.

- C++ starter code for the exercises

## Notes on Content

Most examples and exercises in the worksheets are original and designed specifically for this course. The one major exception is the **Duck Simulator Project** in `03_Project/`, which is a C++ adaptation of the well-known Java project from *Head First Design Patterns* by Freeman & Freeman.
